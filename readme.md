# Motion Detection Tool

Simple motion detector created with Python using OpenCV and Pandas.
The detection is not 100% polished but feel free to modify it at will.

Run `motion_detector.py` to start detecting and when you're done the timestamps of objects entering and exiting the detection will be available in the `Times.csv` file.

You can also run `plotting.py` directly to get the same results but adding a graph visualization of the timestamps.
